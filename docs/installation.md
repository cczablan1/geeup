# Prerequisites and Installation
This assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying

```python``` and then ```pip list```

**geeup now only support Python v3.4 or higher from geeup version 0.3.3**


**This also needs earthengine cli to be [installed and authenticated on your system](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install_manual) and earthengine to be callable in your command line or terminal**

To install **geeup: Simple CLI for Earth Engine Uploads** you can install using two methods.

```pip install geeup```

or you can also try

```
git clone https://github.com/samapriya/geeup.git
cd geeup
python setup.py install
```
For Linux use sudo or try ```pip install geeup --user```.

I recommend installation within a virtual environment. Find more information on [creating virtual environments here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
