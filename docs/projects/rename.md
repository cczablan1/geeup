# geeup Rename

This tool is simply designed to rename filenames to confirm to GEE rules about path renaming including allowing for only hypens or underscores and letters and numbers with no spaces. The tool does do in replace replacement which means it will not create a copy but rename to the same location they are in so use with caution
