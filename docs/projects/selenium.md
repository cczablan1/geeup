# Selenium Setup

Once in a while the geckodriver/selenium requires manual input before signing into the google earth engine, this tool will allow you to interact with the initialization of Google Earth Engine code editor window. It allows the user to specify the account they want to use, and should only be needed once.

**This step is optional and only required if your account does not seem to work or if you have chosen not to use the cookies based authentication method**
